    In the heart of the web, where code and dreams intertwine,
    A language was born, to make our pages shine.
    With each line and loop, with every function and class,
    PHP stands as a pillar, in the vast digital mass.
    
    From simple scripts to complex applications grand,
    It weaves through servers, across the worldwide land.
    A tool for developers, both new and wise,
    PHP is the key that unlocks endless enterprise.
    
    Through years of evolution, it's grown strong and true,
    Supporting the web, in all that we do.
    So here's to PHP, with a thank you so sincere,
    For making the web a place that's ever so dear.
